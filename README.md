## Introduction

Usually the distraction looks the same: you have done some part of the job, it's time to have a break. You open YouTube, TikTok, Facebook and you are gone for hours.

Deep Focus won't let that happen again.

It helps you fight doomscrolling and procrastination. It's made to keep you focused on the job, free from distractions.

## How it works

1️⃣ Add the distracting websites to a blacklist. Any website may be added: Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Simply type "facebook.com" and press "Add." Your blacklisted websites are stored in your browser.

2️⃣ Click the "Enable" button to switch the application to active mode. From now on, whenever you try to access those sources, you'll see a banner reminding you to get back to work.

3️⃣ Once the job is done, click on the "Disable" button to switch the extension back to passive mode. Now you're free to enjoy your favorite websites.

## Technical details

- **Privacy-focused architecture** (no analytics, tracking, or data collection)
- **Entirely client-side processing** (no server communication). Your browser uses local storage to store the blacklisted websites.
- **Browser-level blocking**. No mess with your operating system or router. The blacklisted websites remain completely accessible for your device and in your network - they are just hidden solely for the browser where the extension is active.
